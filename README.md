<p align="center"> ü§ñ Modular LLM Reverse Engineering, Red Teaming, and Vulnerability Research Framework  üñ•Ô∏è </p>

Welcome to **Oversight**! Oversight is a modular, plugin-focused, web-based tool for performing red-teaming and reverse engineering on Large Language Models. Currently, Oversight has a single loader for loading LLMs directly from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?other=LLM). Simply provide the LLM path, and you're good to go. The Oversight framework is modular, and new loaders can be created for various ways of downloading and inspecting LLMs and LLM adapters. Once loaded, LLMs can be inspected for various behaviors and features, including **prompt fuzzing**, **layer analysis**, **jailbreaking bypasses**, and more.



## ‚ú®Features 
- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Extend Oversight‚Äôs capabilities with custom plugins.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Supports adversarial testing, response evasion, prompt fuzzing, etc.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web interface powered by Flask.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate and download comprehensive reports.

## ü§ñ Demo

# üõ†Ô∏èSetup 

## Requirements

Oversight requires Nvidia CUDA. Follow the steps below:
- Ensure your Nvidia drivers are up to date: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/
- Install the appropriate dependancies from here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
- Validate CUDA is installed correctly by running the following and being returned a prompt ```python -c "import torch; print(torch.rand(2,3).cuda())"```
  
## Running

```
pip install git+https://github.com/user1342/oversight.git
./oversight
```
Running Oversight will automatically start the Oversight server and launch it on localhost (```http://127.0.0.1:5000```) in your default browser.

For custom plugins and loaders, either set a custom plugin/ loder path in the Oversight ```config.py``` file, or in your downloaded Oversight plugins/ Loaders folder add your new plugins. 

# üß©Creating Your Own Plugin 
Creating a plugin in Oversight is straightforward. Follow these steps to add your custom plugin:

## Step 1: Create a New Plugin File
Navigate to the plugins directory and create a new folder for your plugin. Inside this folder, create a Python file (e.g., my_plugin.py).

## Step 2: Define Your Plugin Class
Your plugin class should inherit from PluginBase. Here‚Äôs a basic template:

```
from oversight.utils.plugin_base import PluginBase
from flask import jsonify

class MyPlugin(PluginBase):
    def __init__(self, app, session_state):
        config = self._get_config()
        super().__init__(app, session_state, name=config['name'], import_name=__name__, url_prefix=f"/{config['name']}", template_folder='templates')

    def register_routes(self):
        @self.bp.route('/default')
        def default():
            return jsonify({"message": "Hello from MyPlugin!"})

    def to_json(self):
        return {"plugin": self.name, "data": "example_data"}
```

## Step 3: Create a Template
Inside your plugin folder, create a templates folder and add an HTML file (e.g., my_plugin.html). This file defines the front-end interface for your plugin.

## Step 4: Update Configuration
Ensure your plugin‚Äôs configuration is added to the config.json file in your plugin folder. The configuration file should include necessary settings like the plugin name and loader. Example:

```
{
    "name": "My Custom Plugin",
    "size": "small",
    "data": "This plugin demonstrates a custom feature.",
    "hidden": false,
    "loader": "HuggingFaceLoader",
    "priority": 5
}
```

## Step 5: Register Your Plugin
Your plugin will be automatically discovered by Oversight when added to the Oversight plugin folder. Just restart the application, and your plugin should be ready to use!

# üìùReporting
Oversight, in addition to the material web-UI can also output reporting from it's modules to JSON. An example of this can be seen below:
